Hi, I’m Tugce *[ˈtuːtʃe]* — just a girl doing her PhD in AI. I finally found the courage to start the blog I’ve always dreamed of. This is my little corner of the internet where I think out loud about the questions, research, and ideas in AI that light me up.

Whether it’s a cool paper, a strange behavior from a model, or a bit of code that made me pause and smile — if it sparks curiosity, it’ll probably show up here.

Feel free to reach out if you’re working on something exciting in AI or just want to chat! You can find more about me on [my personal page](https://tugcegurbuz.github.io/)
