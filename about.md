Hi, I’m Tugce *[ˈtuːtʃe]* — just a girl doing her PhD in AI. I also have a BSc in neuroscience and psychology, which basically means I spend my days trying to understand how both brains and machines make decisions, store memories, and occasionally do something either brilliant or completely bizarre. Think of me as a therapist for confused robots and overfitted models. 

I finally found the courage to start the blog I’ve always dreamed of. This is my little corner of the internet where I share all the cool (and sometimes chaotic) stuff I’m learning, from research papers to practical AI engineering tricks, experiments that went sideways, code that somehow worked, and the occasional ideas that keeps me up at night. Topics range from cognitive science to deep learning, memory in agents to why my model keeps stuck at corners.

Feel free to reach out if you’re working on something exciting in AI or just want to chat! You can find more about me on [my personal page](https://tugcegurbuz.github.io/)
